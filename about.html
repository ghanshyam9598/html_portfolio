<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi my name is Ghanshyam Singh, i am from Kanpur(U.P).<br/>
I have completed my Graduation in Year 2016.<br/>
In graduation i have done B-tech from Mechanical Engineering from A.K.T.U. Lucknow.<br/>
After B-tech i joined "Cad Desk" as "Mechanical Design Trainer".<br/>
As a trainer i provide training to students in "AutoCad & SolidWorks" Softwares.<br/>
These softwares are use for 2D &3D part modeling of various mechanical parts.<br/>
Because of low scope in mechanical sector i wish to switch my career in I.T Sector as a web developer.<br/>
I am doing Full Stack Web Development course from "Logic Era Institute" Kanpur.<br/>
I hope it will be a right decision for me.<br/>
Thanks!!</p>
